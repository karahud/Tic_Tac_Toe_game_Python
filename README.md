# Tic-Tac-Toe in Python

This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. The game allows two players to take turns selecting their symbols (X or O) and making moves on a 3x3 board until there is a winner or a tie.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay
- Input validation to prevent invalid moves
- Automatic win and tie detection
- Simple and interactive command-line interface

## How to Play
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Player 1 selects either "X" or "O" as their symbol; Player 2 is assigned the opposite symbol.
3. Players take turns entering row and column numbers (0-2) to place their symbol on the board.
4. The game continues until a player wins or the board is full, resulting in a tie.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the `tic_tac_toe.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended).
3. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

## Example Output
